     README – Customer Churn Analysis for Telecom Industry
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using data analytics and machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to users discontinuing telecom services, which directly impacts revenue and customer growth. The goal of this project is to identify churn-prone customers early and support data-driven retention strategies.
Approach
Customer data is aggregated using SQL to extract key usage and behavior metrics such as call duration, complaints, and recharge frequency. A binary classification machine learning model is developed in Python using Scikit-learn to predict whether a customer will churn. Model explainability techniques such as ELI5 or SHAP are applied to identify important factors influencing churn. Customers are further segmented into At-Risk, Loyal, and Dormant groups.
Tools Used
SQL for data aggregation
Python (Scikit-learn, ELI5 ) for churn prediction
Power BI for a one-page churn analysis dashboard
Outcome
The project delivers a churn prediction model, explainable insights into churn drivers, and a Power BI dashboard that enables telecom companies to monitor churn and take proactive retention actions.
